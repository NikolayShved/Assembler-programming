Task 1:
Develop a program for calculating and outputting the values ​​of functions. 
For the value of the argument x entered from IR. 
Allowable limits of change of the argument i = 8, j = 4, a = 15. 
Functions defined by indices i and j: f1 = 〖(x + 3)〗 ^ 3; -20≤x≤20, f2 = 8100 / x ^ 2; 1≤x≤90, k = 8.

Task 2:
Write a program for determining the product of a sequence of numbers C1, C2, ..., Cn.

Task 3:
Compile and debug a training computer program for solving the following problem. 
The three arrays in memory are specified by starting addresses and lengths. 
Calculate and print to the output device the arithmetic mean of the product of all numbers for each array.
